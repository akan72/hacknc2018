I helped you clean out your baggage
In exchange for sometime and a kiss
But I won’t be with you when you’re gone
We were always just kids
It’s hard not to look at this
Problem like a curse
Cause every time I send it at you you send it back
I’ve been taking days off work
To plan the abstract funerals I require
But somehow that always seems to
Involve a blazing involuntary pyre
It’s hard not to look at this
Situation like a pendulum
Cause every time I send it at you you send it back
