Like a villain emptied out of the fun when you're away
I get to feel'n so envious and I watch it tick away
I put a portrait emptied it on the walls up to my face 
But something gets you nothing so I'll try another day 
I can't be like that
Not like to effect 
I can lean in on the breeze it's
No wonder you're alike
I get to feeling envious of the fun when you're away
We can't reclaim the delta it's the one we can’t explain
I keep it like a photograph of the one I'm thinking of
You found me at the wrong time hurling out about myself 
I think I'd wanted that
It fits in my bag
I can see it completely as the walls under attack
I can be like that
I can be like that
I can be — all I need is more time
