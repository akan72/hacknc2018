Chasten your hopes, you’ve got no luck
You walk like a seventh son
But if heaven is a place where nothing gets done
It helps to welcome the day
If summer is the time to go
Your idle mind just run it out
Well I tried and tried to think of something to say
What you waiting for
You’re shading in a box for every day
Get up and welcome the day
Up and welcome the day
Up and welcome the day
