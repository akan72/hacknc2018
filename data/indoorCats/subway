Eunuchs crossing, running for the subway
Keep it from yourself
Your next part of walking on Broadway
I won't give up my sight
And the fall of endtimes it swore the sunshine
They're making a comedown from your cut
Keep a record of the islands say
They'll be a saddle in twain to my heart
Just keep on looking in the eye and say
I never wanted to be apart
I never wanted to be apart
And it's full of incense the roiling sunshine
The gravity pulled you from the cusp
I keep a record of the islands say
They'll be a saddle in twain to my heart
Just keep on looking in the eye and say
I never wanted to be apart
They only wanted to say to you
It’s a rectangle, the top floor of the hospital
The cleaning lady stops and stares she thinks that Beckett’s pretty dull
Nebulas of coffin fitters arch their backs
But leave you on the list for mother’s day gifts and knick knacks
Submarine rider for a year
Submarine rider laps up all that he holds dear
Did you know that you can buy an urn from Amazon
Leave a four star review, if it breaks you can move on
Birthday anniversary a chainsaw in the mail
Still addressed to you the bills and rules a silent jail
Submarine rider for a year
Submarine rider laps up all that he holds dear
Submarine rider for a year
Submarine rider laps up all that he holds dear
