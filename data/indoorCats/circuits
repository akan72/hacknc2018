All the fun I’d had made it apropo and sad
When I went a little mad and wanted you that bad
Amiss but not aloof, I clamor over booths
Filled with herrings and vermouth to soothe the saddened tooth
Awash of karmic retributions
Awash of ample restitutions
I don’t stop the clean the clock
I don’t want you back in my mind
The afternoon was sweet and I had no treat
Not seeing your defeat in the close-minded backseat
It hurt for me at first, hollow rhythms scratching birch
In the valley of thirst, not content with my outburst
I watch the sun lean off the window
I watch the sun lean off the window
I don’t stop to scan the block
I don’t want you back in my mind
Well I’ve seen red across the floor
Entwined with gowns of golden swords
If it’s like what the stitchings say
It wasn’t my words anyway and
In the moon a message gathers
In a circuit ridden by the sun
Attuned to ailing chords
Some misanthropic tune of yours
Of girls entwined with scarves and pleasures
Shoves me between the ledgers
In the woods your silence gathers
In a circle hidden by the sun (oh - oh)
