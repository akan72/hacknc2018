Walk like a ghost in this town
Where the construction just wound down
Amid the mist of the morning
I swore I saw you in the ground
It’s canceled out every time
I only see just what I like
Impossible girl
I can’t give up on your world
That keeps talking to you
I want to be improved
If you’d trust, take it from me
Just tell me that it can’t be
’Cause it’s possible, girl
But I warned you
The reason that they flew
It’s canceled out every time
I only see just what I like
Impossible girl
It’s only half of the world
That keeps talking to you
And I want to be improved, if you’d
Just take it from me
Just tell me that it can’t be
Though it’s possible girl
I warned you the reason that they
Impossible girl
I can’t give up on your world
I keep talking to you1
I want to be improved if you’d
Just take it from me
Just tell me that it can’t be
Oh it’s possible girl
But I warned you the reason that they flew
