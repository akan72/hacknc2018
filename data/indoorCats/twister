I can’t believe what you said
So solipsistic
And you will never get old
Not if I forget your face
This agony that you said
Is always with you
Well it’ll never get out
And no it’s not my fault
I can’t get even with you
You’re in my system
And you will never get out
I don’t know what you’re about
I can’t believe what you said
Your fingers twisted
It was a lie and you know
Although I’ve bought it before
