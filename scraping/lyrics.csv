It's been a while since we have talked
And you have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Because thirty lives can be extraordinarily long

We’re just going to rest up. I don’t think we’ve had actually much time in the process to be with other people and living a life outside of the band. I think that’s what’s in place at the moment, to do very little – especially when it comes to Mumford & Sons.",rock

Your friends are faded let me fill up your cup

Felt like I'd die for you

And I've waited nine for you

38,"Let me tell you about my best friend
Well he's got hair down to his knees
He gets along fine doing just how he please

And I believe that we first met
Around three years ago
Well it feels like a lifetime funny how fast it goes

And I remember how this one time
Well I stole his sister's car
And he didn't even mind no he jumped in for the ride

We'd got miles away from anywhere
When the panic soon kicked in
We'd got it back safe and sound no one asked us where we'd been

Ohh Oh Oh
Ohh Oh Oh

Let me tell you why his sister
Why she didn't second guess
She was going out of line, putting on her favorite dress

And oh by God she knows she's worth it
Any boy would tell you so
Well a girl like that is worth her own weight in gold

Ohh Oh Oh
Ohh Oh Oh

Now I made a promise to myself once
That I would wake up by her side
My best friend said that that would be the day I died

Ohh Oh Oh
Ohh Oh Oh

We found ourselves some treasure, and threw it all away

Impossible way to love you
Incredible love I show
Unstoppable situation decided by my control
Illusion, you feed me fiction

Like anti-freeze, kill me sweetly
You chemical break me down

You're ravenous, time to feed
Keep using your words to cut me
I'm your masochist, make me bleed

I tried it once before but I didn't get too far
I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up

I tried it once before and I think I mighta messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life

Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be

I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough
And I shoulda told my mother 'mom, I love you', like a good son

Take the blade away from me

Yeah, take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain

He put his  finger to his lips

She was a dime in a dozen
Heads flipping off the boys who were chasing tail

She couldn't think too pretty in pink
So he locked her up in a jail
She learned quick no acting like this
How'd you get like this
Why'd she listen what the man say

So let him drive you wild, pour a little bit more

Nos fuimos en la movie baby

[Verso 1: Randy Nota Loca, Nio García]
Borracho y loco
Y sin decirme nada
Te fuiste, me dejaste
Suerte que al menos
Cogí tu número
De ti necesito más
Las ganas me van a matar
Estoy adicto y de ti
Quiero más
No sé qué paso, no te vuelto a ver
Ya el tiempo paso, nunca imagine
Que estaría, borracho y loco
Y todo por usted uh no, uh no, uh iehh

[Verso 2: Randy Nota Loca]
Nota loca
No es nada raro, una nota loca cogí
Estaban pendientes todas las mujeres de mi
Esto es típico, de mi te aprovechaste
Más vale que te aguantes
Y tu lo sabes que si tu estas buena yo me voy
Y tu lo sabes que si tu tienes tu culo voy
Tu sabias que en la disco el del poder soy yo
Por eso tu te fuiste conmigo (Duro)
Y que aquí nadie baila como yo
Por que aquí nadie gasta como yo
Lo que no entiendo fue como paso
Que de momento estábamos en mi habitación
Borracho y loco, tu te aprovechaste
De mi te enganchaste, tu me involucraste
Te tengo en mi mente y no puedo olvidarte

[Verso 2: Nio García]
Recuerdo me la pasaba besándote
Y tu gritando y aruñandome
Sudando y el humo arrebatándome
Tocándote y duro controlándote
Por qué te largaste, yo no sé
Que te pasa, se que no me conoces
No recuerdas, yo fui el que te la puse
Cuando llamabas después de las doce
Y lentamente te quitabas la blusa
Enloquecía cuando apagabas la luces
Para hacerte venir, nunca puse una excusa
Ahora no esperes que venga y me excuse
Siempre llegabas en mi habitación
Con par de copas, entrabas en calor
Yo te quemaba, como quema el sol
Pero te fuiste y no se que paso
Siempre llegabas en mi habitación
Con par de copas, entrabas en calor
Yo te quemaba, como quema el sol
Pero te fuiste y no se que paso

[Verso 3: Bryant Myers]
Bryant Myers
Tu a mi me gustas muñeca
Pero como una diabla se quema en el infierno
Todos los hombres que pecan
Antes me veias y te ponías culeca
Ahora dices que por donde estas seca
Yo extraño esa totito y tus pecas, Romeo y Julieta
Baby yo siempre traigo mi fuleta, ya no soy el mismo
Tal vez no eran compatibles los signos
Se nota en tus ojos que tu espíritu es maligno
Baby yo no te olvido
Todavía no puedo creer que tu te hayas ido
Yo no vuelvo a enamorarme, yo no creo en Cupido
Tu eres la mujer que mas yo he amando
Y la que más (Duro) me haya herido
Ohh, yo ya no soy el mismo
Tu me tiraste para el abismo
Diabla tu eres un satanismo

[Outro: Nio Garcia, Randy Nota Loca, Bryant Myers]
Yo te tengo en mi mente (Bryant Myers)
Tienes algo que no puedo olvidar (Nio)
Por más que trato es imposible  (Mira dímelo movie, Nota Loca)

Hoy me levante
Con ganas de besarte la boca
Con ganas de saber de usted y decirle que
Su cuerpo me provoca

Con ganas de llevarte pa mi cama
Hacerte mía hasta mañana
Con ganas de quitarte la ropa
Tu sola te tocas
Y siempre me llamas

Que la noche sea testigo
De como te castigo
Dime como lo consigo
Un par de horas contigo
Los dos en el cuarto encendio'

Que la noche sea testigo
De como te castigo
Baby estoy loco contigo
Tengo frió ven dame tu abrigo
Y vuelvo y te castigo

[Verso 1: Nio Garcia]
Mi muñeca arrebata
Me pones tu cara de sata
Cuando te castigo y maltrata
Tu sigue que de eso se trata

Chingando bebé me gradué
Ese toto es mío ya lo averigüé
En la cama le metes cabrón
Pero dile que fue el que te enseñe yo (Nio)

Tu siempre te portas mal
Por hijaeputa te voy a castigar
Solo en 4 te voy a perdonar
Baby arrodíllate y ponte a rezar

[Verso 2: Miky Woodz]
Dame tu celular
Porque contigo quiero coronar
Dime donde va’ a estar
Que yo le llego hasta sin preguntar

Me dice papi Woody
Me enamore de su boobie
Activo Day ‘N’ Nite un piquete Kid Cudi
En la disco manda a pedir 10 botellas Flow Movie

El cabrón ese no sabe que andas conmigo
Me le vengo de jump en el ombligo
Viendo el NBA con los amigos

Hoy desperté
Con ganas de estar un par de horas contigo
Donde no existan testigos
No vo’a ser tu abrigo vo’a darte castigo baby

Yo sé que me quieren matar están puesto pa’ mi
Mientras te chingo yo saque el primero
Vo’a ser dinero
Millonario antes de que se acabe el mundo
Y olvidar de los problemas cuando te lo hundo

[Coro: Nio Garcia]
Que la noche sea testigo
De como te castigo
Baby estoy loco contigo
Tengo frió ven dame tu abrigo
Y vuelvo y te castigo

[Verso 3: Casper]
Hoy me levante
Con ganas de tenerte pensando en tu culo
Pensando en todas las veces que en la boca te lo eche
Que te la tire, adentro te lo deje
Con tu totito baby yo me moriré

Hicimos un pacto
Por siempre chingar hasta que yo me muera
Aunque yo este con ella y tú estés allá afuera
Y si yo caigo preso mi bicho tu espera

Aunque tú vives quizás en esa condena
Por siempre mi girla, por siempre mi nena

Que la noche sea testigo
De como te castigo
Baby estoy loco contigo
Tengo frió ven dame tu abrigo
Y vuelvo y te castigo

Tú dices que yo soy igual que los demás

Siempre la misma vaina
Y yo pensándolo bien
Es la misma excusa que usan las mujeres
Y llegué a la conclusón que tú eres... igual o peor

Siempre anda llena de maldad
Eres mala (Igual o peor)
Por el día me maldice
En la noche me ama (Igual o peor)
Peor que yo
Igual o peor

Ya no jugaré más el juego

Y ahora te pasa' hablando por ahí
Con lujos y detalles cada vez que yo te falle
Y porque no te has olvida'o 'e mí (de mí)
Si pasas por mi cama antes de romper la calle (uh yeh)

Su amiga a mí no me soporta no, no, no
Porque siempre ando con una escolta y una glock
Compré esta marihuana y enrolé un blunt
Pa mí que tú eres igual o peor

Antes yo era tu nene
Tu alma gemela cuando te conviene
Y a ti, nada te detiene
Pensando en mí cuando único te vienes (Igual o Peor)

Ponte el baby doll pa' que me lo modeles (Igual o Peor)
Me pides que te dé duro, que no te duele (no, yeh)

Me encojona estar conmigo, baby, porque por dentro, sé que te quiero (yeah)
Aquí yo sigo vivo, aunque pensaba que sin ti, baby, yo me muero (yeah)
Ahora sin ti, yo me siento bien

Ya yo no soy el mismo, me siento en un abismo
Ohh, vacío, vacío, ohh

Yo naci un 3 de febrero
Renaci en un 6 de enero
La muerte vino a buscarme pa' hacerme su prisionero
Un AK truena en el cielo
Entre el panico y el miedo
Se forma el corre y corre
Raymond Ayala en el suelo
Tuve una visión vi mi vida pasar en segundos
Vi como se abría un túnel pa' mandarme al otro mundo
El cuerpo bañado  en sangre y agonizando aclamé
Mas tiempo te pido padre, Dios mio perdóname
Y asi fue como ya entré en su plan
Me vinieron a rematar
De la nada ellos se van
No estoy muerto son rumores
Guarden su corona de flores
Silenciaron los tambores
De esto aprendi que para el cielo no hay elevadores
La calle fuego algun dia va a quemarte
La vida te da sorpresas tienes que prepararte
Solo un adicto en el tiroteo vino a salvarme

Todavia lidio con el trauma que me dejaron
Y reconosco que sera hasta que muera
Pero que tico he sido el mas duro en esta carrera
Me a tocado un destino que no habia entendido
Cuando miro al pasado esto tiene sentido
Valio la pena la balasera perder la escuela
La silla de ruedas, el hospital y lo que e sufrido
Ya se fue el dolor de aquel entonces
Ahora son mas de 100 mil en los concert
Jamas pense hasta donde llegaria mi nombre
Con la bendicion divina por el hijo del hombre
Son millones de fans los que estan siguiendo mi huella
Hasta mi sello El Cartel ya tiene su propia botella
De moribundo pase a ser una super estrella

Hey, no lo piensen dos veces así que se den cuenta, dale vámonos
Deja la pichaera se te nota que quiere ir conmigo
Un flow demasiado cabrón 'ta buscando que te coma ese culito
Dime si tu 'ta dispuesta a recibir mucho castigo
Móntate en mi coche, asicalao de color cherry
No baje los cristales, que se escapa la neblina
120 en el dash y esta va por la avenida
Demacia' velocidad, no lo puede parar ni la policía
Licencia vencida, no tengo tiempo pa' tonterías
Mientras 'toy guillando, desemoña enseguida
Dale rompe philly, sube el volumen al máximo
De La Geezy, ziggy Daddy, Musicólogo con Menes, mira que paso

[Coro: Del La Ghetto, Daddy Yankee]
Si tu quiere después de aquí nos vamos para el After Party
Diles a tus amigas si quieren ir
Vamos a escaparnos tú y yo para el After Party
Sé que te lo vas a vivir
Después del party lo que viene mami es el After Party
Te apuesto que nos van a seguir
Sus anfitriones son los jefes, De La Geezy con el ziggy Daddy
Dime que mas quieres pedir

[Verso 3: Daddy Yankee, De La ghetto]
Tengo la botella
Pide lo que quiera
Este party se jodio
Una fantasía
Que tú quería
Adivina se te dio
Tu 'ta donde tienes que estar
Que nada te me desenfoque
Andas con el jefe grande ma'
Con el jefe del bloque
Como la tierra fértil 'tas buscando que te siembre
Vamo' a vacilar como el 31 de diciembre
DJ sube la música que ahora esto se enciende
Mujer quita mahon que se me activa el duende

[Pre-Coro: De La Ghetto]
Hay nena lo que quiero conocerte, hablarte mami
Desde el momento que te vi
Tú eres mi fantasía
Ay chula que sería tu sin mí

[Coro: Del La Ghetto, Daddy Yankee]
Si tu quiere después de aquí nos vamos para el After Party
Diles a tus amigas si quieren ir
Vamos a escaparnos tú y yo para el After Party

(Mujeres Alerta)
Alerta Roja
King Daddy
El Nuevo Orden Mundial De La Musica
Let 'em know, Zion

[Coro: Zion]
Mujeres alerta, llego el combo que las calienta
En la disco corremos con la cuenta
Dale cáiganle, dale caiganle, wow, wow
La calle esta alerta, seguimos sumando la venta
Aquí nadie con nosotros inventa
Dale tírense, dale tírense, wow, wow

[Verso 1: Nicky Jam]
El más subestimado en esto, tranquilo yo no estaba molesto
Yo sabía que llegaba mi tiempo, Papá Dios mi maestro
Me dijo Nicky Jam tate' quieto
Que lo tuyo viene duro y por eso

El Ave Fénix me dicen porque de las cenizas me hice
Y ahora no va haber quién me pise
Los deje como un freezer, hasta yo mismo dije que hice
Oye Yankee vamos hacer que aterricen

Saga déjame cambiar el flow
Alerta, aquí ninguno inventa, somos los de la venta
Ustedes no pueden con nosotros
Intentan, pero los numero aumentan
Por eso es que se molestan, aquí llegaron los más valiosos

[Verso 2: Arcángel]
Tírate si quieres o si no quédate en tu casa
Que aquí todo el mundo tiene lo suyo melaza
Llego al party y todo el mundo se pregunta ¿qué pasa?
Volvió el enano otra vez tumbando la casa

Y yo le bajo el pozo como El Chavo del Ocho
Le gusta que le mientan y yo soy Pinocho
Ando en un maquinón fumando sins
De apellido Royce y no se llama Prince

Se acabó el aburrimiento colegas
Si sale Arcángel de seguro la canción se pega
De nuevo Austin, mi apellido debería ser caro
Compro caro, vivo caro, mi vida es un descaro

[Verso 3: De La Ghetto]
Donde yo piso se convierte en dinero
Las mujeres lloran gritando por De La Ghetto
En mi movimiento los que controlan la esfera
Ustedes esperan afuera, mis cifras son verdaderas

Y yo he notao' mucho con mi flow bien copia'o
Hasta fallan de tiro libre, están escocota'a
Las doble cubanas, Gucci de abajo pa' arriba
King swag daddisito el dueño de la tarima

[Coro: Daddy Yankee]
Mujeres alerta, llego el combo que las calienta
En la disco corremos con la cuenta
Dale cáiganle, dale cáiganle, wow, wow
La calle esta alerta, seguimos sumando la venta
Aquí nadie con nosotros inventa
Dale tírense, dale tírense, wow, wow

[Verso 4: Kafu Banton]
Ahora sacúdete, dale pa' abajo y súbete
Ponte de espalda y luego acentúate
Y si no te sientes bien ubícala sitúate
No te preocupes solo quiero ser tu cuate

Mujeres alerta, miren pa' la puerta
Que llego el que las va a poner a todas contentas
Cuando toco la tarima eso se revienta
Porque el flow que tengo es fresco como menta

Estoy haciendo esto como desde los 90's
Ahora me dicen mutante se dieron de cuenta
Cuando saco mi trabajo la gente comenta
Kafu Banton, Panamá siempre representa

[Verso 5: Chencho]
Empezó en la esquina y luego fue creciendo
Al mundo ya está viendo, el calor están sintiendo
La calle tiene nombre, se escucha de voces en voces
Y la cuna donde se bate el cobre

Las mujeres con los mejores closets
Tienen estar lucias siempre tienen donde
Buscan lo que le gusta y el desorden
Y las maquinas aborden

[Verso 6: Maldy]
Salgo en la noche y como siempre a prepararme
Acicalarme, ponerme los diamantes
Una gatita en el club impresionarle
Que sea soltera pa' que sea mejor el trance
De seguro me la levante
Rutinas de jangueo que normalmente a mí me pase
Vivo viajando el mundo, placeres dándome
Con mente ganador, siempre mujeres llevándome

[Verso 7: J Balvin]
De mi país yo soy el icono, pocos dicen que no
Pero esos pocos siguen siendo mis discípulos
Ahora hasta los críticos me están dando el título
De que en el Reggaetón escribí un nuevo capitulo

Lo mío es real lo, tuyo es película
Si ves to' los juguetes, esta mi nombre en las matriculas
Las mujeres caen como aguacero de noviembre
Estoy condenado a ser bendecido por siempre, muy bless

Alerta roja pa' toas las mujeres
Que los ninjas estamos en la zona
Somos el combo que las descontrola

[Coro: Zion]
Mujeres alerta, llego el combo que las calienta
En la disco corremos con la cuenta
Dale cáiganle, dale cáiganle, wow, wow
La calle esta alerta, seguimos sumando la venta
Aquí nadie con nosotros inventa
Dale tírense, dale tírense, wow, wow

[Verso 8: Farruko]
Alerta roja, la calle encendia' como troya
Nadie me cruza las líneas, ni las boyas
La movie prendía, el negocio y la calle es mía
Nos quedamos con los trenes y las vías

Tenemos la atención de todas las babys yo corro con la cuenta
Se quedan mirando la máquina con los aros
El Jeep parece Hummer le metí como 50
Pa' pasarle por encima a ustedes y a sus carros caros

Que son leasing, están embrolla'o, lo mío esta saldo
No hay prestamos, tengo par de millones de respaldo
La chapis chapis se pegan como pez a una pecera
Cuando ven el botelleo y el brillo de mi pulsera

[Verso 9: Cosculluela]
Alerta, alerta, que me cierren las compuertas
¿Coscu donde está tu competencia? Muerta
Despierta, yo espero que tengan cubierta
Cada vez que salgo dejo la pista desierta

Faraón de los banners, sortijas como MC Hammer
Monumento, como los huesos de Tutankamón
El Messi hacen pipas en latas de Pepsi
Después de pal de cachas
Como que se sienten sexy

Golpea, mi voz nunca titubea
Sigo fuerte como el norte de Corea
Mil hermanos he perdido por los cambios de marea
Que en paz descanse Chespi
Y que en paz descanse Correa Boy

Yo sigo Humacao, millones a choca'o
Mis conciertos sold out, paga la entrada
Sal de las libretas doradas
Soy la cima, por encima del Princi nada

[Verso 10: El Micha]
Dale más volumen que esto se jodió, el Micha llego
Alerta roja, que la disco se reventó
Demasiado fuerte, esto viene demasiado duro
Ando que hasta vestido de negro me veo en lo oscuro

Esto es palo, palito, palo seguro
Que nosotros andamos en naves que parecen del futuro
Tiburonas que quieren comerme crudo
Que andan con sus novios y me miran y me saludo

Y ahora déjala que baile
Que llegaron los dueños de la calle
Nosotros no creemos en nadie
Alerta roja pa' que la disco no pare, no pare, no pare

[Coro: Zion, Chencho]
Mujeres alerta, llego el combo que las calienta
En la disco corremos con la cuenta
Dale cáiganle, dale cáiganle wow, wow
La calle esta alerta, seguimos sumando la venta
Aquí nadie con nosotros inventa
Dale tírense, dale tírense, wow, wow

[Verso 11: Brytiago]
Ieeee, tengo un pal conectas
Que lucen perfectas
Puestas pa la vuelta, ieeee eee
Pidan los que quieran que la cuenta está cubierta

¡Uy, uy! Mala mía no fue mi intención
A tu gata, tuve que aplicarle la inyección
El baby ahora es la nueva atracción
Cartel, Brytiago y El Boss

[Verso 12: Alexio]
Saca la pala pal' hoyo, que si no te capeo' el royo
Pimpollo, le vamos a cortar el hilo a tu yoyo
Maniobra en bebas, pa' darle martillo
Yo no quiero ser jevo, déjeme de chillo

Gritaron una bruja y no se despertaron
To' los que ha chocao conmigo más nunca se pararon
Pa' la cera que al que la calle se le suba
Se va a tener que mudar pa' Aruba, hey

Alerta, alerta, que se te va a caer la vuelta
Nadie nos atranca la vía a nosotros
Por eso que tu línea está muerta

[Verso 13: Mozart]
Mami chula quiere un trago, pidan to' que yo lo pago
Si tú me frotas está lámpara, te va aparecer un mago
Yo no soy un buzo, pero quiero nadar en tu lago
Y muchas cosas heavy te hago

Es que mi mente de infinito llega, yo sé que aquí tú no llega
La mujer que usted se liga hasta la seguridad la brega
Yo empiezo a beber temprano, aunque me acueste tarde
Donde están, vamos por ellos que son pocos y cobardes

[Verso 14: Secreto]
A ella le gusta el piquete que tiene este prieto
A pecha de mi porque sabe que no invento
Llégale al flow que tenemo' los dominicanos
Y donde quieran que llegamos metemo' manos

Que lo que, siempre estamos activos, a cualquier efectivo
Pa' los envidiosos siempre ando con mi chaleco
Pilas de plomo y cachazo pa' to' esos frescos

[Verso 15: Jacob Forever]
Y esto esta como agua para chocolate
Pa' que pruebe y pa' que te arrebates
Otro quilate, aquí no hay empate
Si no mira Gente De Zona donde está

[Verso 16: Alexander Delgado]
Ye, ye, ye, que dime qué bola
La voz que te tiene toa' la disco reventa'
Demasiado duro, esto es alerta roja
Soy Gente De Zona y combo no se afloja

Aviso pa' tu nación, llego la invasión
Le baja a la movie o te lleva el Armagedón
Los felicito, han ganado fama, carritos y sus tenis caras
Pero eso lo explote pa' en mi primer millón

¡Millones sobre millones y que pasó!
¡Mis barrios son las mansiones y que pasó!
Bajo la ventana sin decir nada muestro mi cara
Y tu gata se monta sola, ¡papi que paso!!!

Que arranquen, que no existe quien me estanque
Como un soldado va a pararse de enfrente al tanque
Bichotes de Instagrammy que tienen pa' mi
Soy la vía que les suple al mundo los kilogrammy

Tu eres ciego o es que no ves, como Daddy lo pone a valer
Todos suben de nivel cuando el sello lo pone Cartel
Demostré que ni el gobierno, pudo ponerme censura
La palabra Reggaetón la hice parte de la cultura

Soy la moda en Paris ¡Oh!, con el flow de New York ¡Oh!
El delivery perfecto, me llaman Daddy ZipCode
Hay unos cuantos rezando pa' que mi carrera expire
¿Que será del genero el día que DY se retire? ¡Ah!

Mucho mami por aquí, mucho baby por aquí hey

Un par de lunáticos con aire en sus neumáticos

Salimos todo el combo vale estamos aquí filtraos
Envueltos aquí perreando pero mirando pal lado
Pendiente al celular por si mi gata a llamado
Por si otro celular me tienen retratao

Hey shorty como quiera tu y yo vamo hacer

I'm sorry pichendo nos fuimos los dos hasta abajo
Don't worry
Stop, So-socio con permiso te piso no me tumbes el piso

See the first snow fall to the ground
It just don't feel right when you're not around
Supposed to be the happiest time of the year
Would you say that for me?
Wrapped up in my winter coat walking down the street
Trying not to hate on every couple that I see
The only thing I got on my list is you here with me, yup

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh Ad-Lib]
I don't wanna be alone in December
I don't want a tear to fall Christmas Eve (oohhh)
And I got so many presents to send (ya)
Please come back to me

[Chorus: Becky G w/Aaron Fresh]
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me, yea
I'll be right here next year
Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me
(So won't you wait for me...)

[Verse 2: Aaron Fresh]
Every other holiday I was by your side
I would give them all away to have a solid night
Supposed to be the jolliest time of the year
But it just ain't for me, no
Carolers are singing
I just wanna hold your hand
Not having you here with me is more than I can stand
On the next flight, pick me up when I land
I don't wanna be alone...

I don't wanna be alone in December
I don't want a tear to fall Christmas Eve
And I got so many presents to send ya
Please come back to me
I'll be coming back, Becky G

Baby I'll wait for you, so won't you wait for me

[Bridge: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh]
So, hang the stocking up
Where's the mistletoe?
And when I get home
Who know where this will go?
I never wanna be alone when it's cold out
So turn the lights on, I'm on my way to your house
And we don't need a gift
You got me wrapped up
I put a bow on just to make you crack up
And we can hang all night, no phone
I need a buddy in my snow globe, shawty

[Pre-Chorus: Becky G w/ Aaron Fresh]
I don't wanna be alone in December
I don't want a tear to fall Christmas Eve
And I got so many presents to send ya (bring it back here, girl)

I won’t stop 'til I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

I won’t stop 'til I get to the top
I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

[Verse 1: Becky G]
Yo, first grade, Oak Street elementary
A few blocks from the Inglewood cemetery
I lived through hard times, according to my memory
Then I learned to rhyme like I’m reading off the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso Market
Even though I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grandpa’s garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I'mma be a crossover
Right now it’s just who is that girl?
But one day I'mma be all around the world
I still get grounded, always stay grounded
Still do chores even when I’m on tour
One thing’s for sure, I'mma always be me
That West Side Becky, Becky G

I’m so I’m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

[Verse 2: Becky G]
Yo, what you know about the In-N-Out life?
And what you know about that 405 drive?
My life is changing quickly right before my eyes
It hits me every time that I’m on Hollywood and Vine
If you wanna date me, you gotta ask my daddy
And my 30 uncles, you can meet them in an alley
And one day I'mma bring home a Grammy
But no matter what I’ll be bringing home Randy's Donuts
So what, holler when you see me
I’m still the same B, even when I’m on TV
Still rocking Js with my diamonds and pearls
You can take me out the hood, but not the hood out of the girl
Yes I love sushi, love my calamari
But ain't no better chef than my very own mommy
If you can’t catch me roaming in my barrio
I’m with my 'litas praying the Rosario
(Inglewood, Inglewood, Inglewood)

I won’t stop 'til I get to the top

Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from

74,"Is it just me or am I just dreamin
Could this really be or am I just sleepin
All i know is it's a crazy feelin
I know one beyond me is a just lurkin
Ceramic for my soul
Pull me in the dark and never let me out to see the new dawn and
I'm screamin and cryin and dyin
And it's sad to see
It's like I'm nobody's kiss me

Stranger and stranger
Everyone's a stranger
It's hatred and anger and everyone's in danger
Lions ant Tigers and demons and wolf packs, runnin, you keep runnin but you just too scared to look back
Keep you mind forward none of this is really happinin
As soon as you escape the fantasies come back again
Relapse, tell yourself to relax
Chillin take your seat back
This is all just a dream that's
A glimpse anf it's ruining your vision, puttin you into submission, it's breathin, it's coughin, it's teasin, it's stalkin
It takes you by the heart and pulls you deep in the coffin
It's callin and I can feel it watchin
I see it through my eyelids and my mind is filled with violence
I'm stranded on an island
I may need a sum of silence
But I keep on hearin Sirens and I can't really take it
Enough of fighting darkness it's time I just embrace it

Is it just me or am I just dreamin
Could this really be or am I just sleepin
All i know is it's a crazy feelin
I know one beyond me is a just lurkin
Ceramic for my soul
Pull me in the dark and never let me out to see the new dawn and
I'm screamin and cryin and dyin
And it's sad to see
It's like I'm nobody's kiss me

It's like a monster coming to get me
I'm trying to run but they playing high dancey
The twisten up my mind
They makin me crazy
Like a tornado
Oh tsunami brakin Haiti
All i know is
I need to get away
But something made me curious and made me want to stay
The skys no longer blue and the clouds are turnin grey
The waters turnin red and the lights are fadin away

Dreams become reality
Livin in a tragedy
Lool at this catastrophe
The story is unraveling
Changen up the strategies they prey becomes the predator
Fillin up the raptor
With never mores and metaphors
Ballet of the dead come from every single stanza
Lookni for the angels but the devils had me ambushed
Reachin for the sky and hope I levitate fly
I'm a goony till the end cause goonies never say die

Is it just me or am I just dreamin
Could this really be or am I just sleepin
All i know is it's a crazy feelin
I know one beyond me is a just lurkin
Ceramic for my soul
Pull me in the dark and never let me out to see the new dawn and
I'm screamin and cryin and dyin
And it's sad to see
It's like I'm nobody's kiss me

I know a place
Where things are so strange
And your make believing
But you aren't dreaming
And the worlds still turning
That your mind is sterling

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Is it just me or am I just dreamin
Could this really be or am I just sleepin
All i know is it's a crazy feelin
I know one beyond me is a just lurkin
Ceramic for my soul
Pull me in the dark and never let me out to see the new dawn and
I'm screamin and cryin and dyin
And it's sad to see
It's like I'm nobody's kiss me",latin

Ella es mía na' más y no tiene competencia
Marca la diferencia, es calla'ita con inteligencia
Su mirada es la que me atrapa, y como me habla me mata

Bebé, yo se que tú mientes cuando hablas

Esas nalgas rebotan cuando tú bailas
Baby tú eres una diabla disfrazada de mujer
Bebecita, desde que lo hicimos
Yo no he podido olvidarme de ti
Como una cicatriz que nunca borra
Baby tú dejaste tu marca en mí
Bebé, yo se que tú mientes cuando hablas
Pero tú tienes un poder de convencer
Esas nalgas rebotan cuando tú bailas

Al parecer no sabes como es que te extraño
Como yo te quiero, tu falta me hace daño
Viene a mi mente un recuerdo si me hablan de ti
Pero no pierdo la esperanza que vuelvas a mí
Recordar que queríamos
Quiero volver a sentir como lo hacíamos
Una mirada decía lo que sentíamos
El amor con el que tú y yo mami viviamos
¿Como es que lo hacíamos?
Recordar que queríamos
Quiero volver a sentir como lo hacíamos
Una mirada decía lo que sentíamos
El amor con el que tú y yo mami viviamos

[Intro: Ken-Y, Ozuna]
Anda, ve corriendo a donde ese infeliz para luego volver a mí
Para que consuele tu llanto
No es la primera vez que lo haces, decídete
Si te quedas con él, a mí no me mires más (baby)
Si quieres otra vez, entonces ve donde él está

[Coro: Ken-Y, Ozuna]
Besos mojados, labios invisibles
Gemidos inaudibles, que te atormentan sin voluntad
Besos mojados, labios invisibles
Gemidos inaudibles, que me atormentan sin voluntad

Ella no se decide, pero como me jode y me exige
A veces me llama por Facebook pa' que yo la cobije
Ella es bipo-lar, parece que siempre dice
Que no quiere nada serio, pero se contradice
Y me busca, sólo para sexo me usa
Tenemos una relación bastante confusa
Qué cosa, si la diabla me engatusa
Si le hablo de amores siempre me pone mil excusas

Y aún sigo esperando, el tiempo pasando
Yo sé que con él tus noches son fría'

Que yo deseo que to' el día pase

Besos mojado', eso me pasa sólo a tu lado
Si tú te me va', ¿cómo le hago?

Y si alguna vez tú lo duda'

Inocencia, en un mundo lleno de violencia
Sin pensar en consecuencias
Ya la paciencia no es competencia pa' la demencia

Veo todo blanco y negro, ya nada tiene color

Y rechazar lo que el mundo les imponía

Dime quién encendía

81,"[Verse 1]
Everybody needs an anchor
A little something that makes you stay
An incentive, someone to fight for
Cause no one really needs so much space

A couple years ago I was lonely
I used to think that there was no God
But then you looked at me with your blue eyes
And my agnosticism turned into dust

[Pre-Chorus]
How well you know me
That I don’t care if the rest don’t
It doesn’t matter to me, no ohh
Oh-oh-oh and as long as you love me
As long as we still have each other

[Chorus]
I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
Pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa
Ahh- ahh

[Verse 2]
God knows that I’m a good dancer
My feet can move to the music he plays
But there were times I asked for an answer
When he was acting in mysterious ways

There were nights that I stayed up crying
Cause I was certain that things wouldn't change
But then you came and I saw you smiling
Just like an angel, so beautifully strange

[Pre-Chorus]
And then you touched me
It's like you were made for me, oh-oh
Like it was all meant to be, oh-oh
And I was sure that you would love me
And that we'd always have each other

[Chorus]
I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23
Pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa pararapa-pararapa
Ohh- ohh

[Bridge]
Always thought that I was fine but I was wrong
It was you, that one piece I was missing
And I could do without you but, it'd be no fun
I found you and life was suddenly easy
There ain't no worries now
There ain't no feeling down

[Chorus]
I knew we had something
From the moment I met you
I knew we had something
No one thought it could be true
Hey do you believe
Do you believe in destiny?
Cause I do as I did then
When you were only 23",latin

[Verso 1]
Debe ser el perfume que usas
O el agua con la que te bañas
Pero cada cosita que haces
A mí me parece una hazaña
Me besaste esa noche
Cual si fuera el último día de tu boca
Cada vez que yo me acuerdo
Yo siento en mi pecho el peso de una roca

Son tus ojos marrones
Esa veta verdosa
Es tu cara de niño
Y esa risa nerviosa

Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer
I'm addicted to you
Porque es un vicio tu piel
Baby, I'm addicted to you
Quiero que te dejes querer

[Verso 2]
Por el puro placer de flotar
Ahora si me llevó la corriente
Ya no puedo dormir ni comer
Como lo hace la gente decente
Un recuerdo ha quedado
Así como un broche prendido en mi almohada
Y tú en cambio que tienes memoria de pez
No te acuerdas de nada

Son tus manos de hombre
El olor de tu espalda
Lo que no tiene nombre
Lo logró tu mirada

El mundo lo sabe, no es ningún tabú

Lo que me hace idolatrarte así, es todo tú

Ver los efectos que causas tú
Con tu sonrisa angelical llenas la habitación de luz
Solo en ti encuentro satisfacción
Hay tanto por descubrir aún
Es todo una dulce confusión
Y tu piel es la plenitud

Problemas de un niño normal:

Quiero ser una super estrella, tener todos los lujos
Que se rieguen los rumores que fui parte de un embrujo
Que el diablo me sedujo con prendas y con carros
Y con ponerme por encima de to' estos charros
Na', con él no hablo
Y no quiero ser el diablo de esto, tampoco Dios
Soy original en lo que hago
Sólo soy un ser humano que dentro de su mortalidad, tiene la habilidad de matar cada vez que grabo.
Soy inmune a comentarios y a la radiación
Todavía no salgo en la radio ni en la televisión
Mato sin la intención, todo es sin querer
Tengo el poder de capturarte con componer una canción
Aunque estoy de vacaciones, ya no escribo mis canciones
Tengo a dos cabrones arriba de mí haciendo esas funciones
Yo les pago con la vida, ellos me dan toda su letra
Ellos fueron los que escribieron esta canción completa.
Son de otro planeta, con naves espaciales, lápiz especiales, problemas mentales
Son experto creando historias artificiales
Lo que ellos hace a más nadie le sale.

Por mi cuenta no pudiera; yo sólo hago garabatos
Palabreo tecato, mas unos cuantos beats baratos
Me hicieron unos cuantos, pero ya no quiero trabajar
Porque me debo chavos con cojones, y no tengo con que pagar.
¡Pero ustedes no, muchachos! ¡Dale quiero dos canciones!
Una que vean que fumo hierba, y otra hablando de millones
Chavos con cojones, a mí sin cojones
Los versos que siempre tiran son de colecciones
Aunque parezca ficticio, al final ese es su oficio
No quieran que un chef construya un edificio
Son mis escritores y escriben de lo que todos viven
Cada cual ve lo que quiere, son ustedes quien deciden
Tener la imaginación, ser soñador de ocupación
Crear tu propio mundo escuchando una canción
Yo no salgo del mío, con los míos, pa' ningún lao'
¿Que tal todo por allá? 🙂 ✌🏻Chao

Yo no soy Don Omar (¡Don!) pero soy bandolero (¡wouh!)
Por eso solo creo en Dios (amén) y en mis cuatro cero' (¡prrr!)
Yeah, picante, picante como un habanero (¡wo-woh!)
Si tú tienes la llave, yo tengo el llavero (¡prrrrra!)

La gente ya sabe, por eso ni ronco
No me llevo con nadie, andamos flow Stone Cold (what?)
Saqué mil doscientos y me puse una' Concord (hehe)
Túmbame el piquete de bronco (¡woo!)
No es meter presión, es saber meterla
A tu mujer en cuatro voy a ponerla
Chingando y fumando un pasto de la perla (¡prrra!)
Tu cara ya nadie va a reconocerla
No es tener la villa, cabrón, es moverla
Tú odias mi vida pero es porque quieres tenerla, yeh, yeh, yeh
Porque vivimos chido, vivimos bien
Porque sobran botellas y billetes de cien
Tratando de matarme han gastado to'a las balas del almacén
Pero soy inmortal como Baby Rasta y 50 Cent, yeh, yeh, yeh

Unos me lo maman, otros me difaman
Mientras las gatas me pagan
Pa' hacerles conciertos privados en su cama
Hablan de mí, buscando fama
Eso tiene un precio, llamen a Walter a ver si cuadra

[Coro]
Están enamorados de mí, de mí
Están asustados desde que salí
Tranquilo papi seguiré así
Si con 23 el culo les partí, no los dejare dormir

[Verso 1]
No me gane un premio y sobran conciertos
Seamos sinceros, vamos a lo cierto
¿Qué hacen sold out?, eso es incierto
¿Tú vendes copias?, si están en descuento

Mucho carro y mucho bling bling bling
Y del banco siempre suena el ring ring
Paga tu leasing, que estás atrasado
Te lo advirtieron, no gastes más de lo adelantado

Buscando inspiration pa' romper los rankings

None of these motherfuckers could touch me
I don't give a fuck if you think you could
I'll still beat your ass like you from another hood
Still smokin' Woods, still givin' bitches wood
In a wishin' well 'cause I still wish a nigga would
Hah, you ain't shit to a boss
Rev her up like an engine until it give her exhaust
All these rappers I'm killing, I'm turning into a villain
My Nina be a horny bitch the way I'm getting her off
Randy Moss for your boy how I'm pickin' 'em off
I'm pickin' 'em out, these other niggas chickenin' out
I'm chewin' 'em up, pause, then I'm spittin' 'em out
I'm bein' general, don't make me start singlin' out
First thing's first, bitch, keep my name out your mouth
Before the doctor have to take your fuckin' brain out your mouth
I may just show up to your next concert with a AK
Just to see what all that fuckin' hype is about
Now it's blood on my Louis V's
Bad bitch like my clothes, came from overseas
Ex-girl gettin' mad, said she over me
Knowin' damn well that I'm still in them ovaries
Bitch, please, I see bullshit around me
Hoes tryna clown me
As soon as I get money, I bet them bitches surround me
All my money goin' to new clothes and wardrobe
So I can't help but be fresher than Downy
Orange VLONE like I'm straight out the county
Louis Vuitton don mixed up in Givenchy
Same way Hennessy mix up in Bacardi, haha
Damn, so how the fuck you gon' stop me?

I run laps around these niggas in they school raps
I'm still doggin' with them cool cats
I'm still pretty when I sit back
I break your bitch for the Kit Kat
You niggas broke, you can't fix that
The competition is a mismatch
You think it's cool to fuck with me on a bad day
And lately, I've been havin' a lot of those
You pussy niggas so uptight
That if you put your big boy pants on
You'll be rocking a camel toe
I'm such a animal
I'm such a cannibal
Body parts in my Danimals
I'm super radical
Pussy, you not compatible
You niggas itch like rashes
You claim niggas' after me, so call me cautious
Them hoes used to laugh at me but now they askin'
The whereabouts to all my fashion
If we could have sex on camera
Like I don't have real life standards
Guess I don't have real life standards, huh?

Relation by blood or relation by color?
Hmm, man, I don't give a fuck

This the talk of a boss
Keep playin' wit' yo' boy and I'll be checkin' yo' pulse
Probably put you in a hospital, piss on your bed

The music, the liquor that’s why I exist
And the money, but let's skip the obvious shit
Ain't living too long if I'm living like this
Early morning waking up with the sweats
Going through shit I ain't never forget
But nothing I do, will I ever regret
I need me that cheque, I need me that chronic
I don't remember, tell me what's my name?
Drinking, swerving in the other lane
Fucking zooted drinking acid rains
Spill it on Supreme

[Chorus]
40 got me funky (funky)
I popped a molly (molly), went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries (ain't got no)
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze (kami)
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries

Made a lot of M's, made a lot of O's
Open up the safe (ooh), I'm just with the bros
Cop the 458, cost me 250 (yeah)

I did not believe that it would end, no
Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

I just wonder what it’s gonna take
Another foreign or a bigger chain (bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around

They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up

Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy

I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos

We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole

Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go
And tell me today's weather

I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater
Really it's whatever
I am murdering and this is so amusing
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion

These London street lamps got a real glow
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow

I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry
But I ain't playing high school games
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra

109,"The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was ""Pon de Replay,"" and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called ""Work.""

Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.

Captivating from day one, the iconic being known as Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them that's often a peak, but for her that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.

When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.

What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.

This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.

She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.",hiphop

Plus you lack delivery, not to brag
I don't need to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost

All I know is that I'd die for pot, make the cypher hot
Smoke weed and fuck up my life a lot
Give me the money now, bitch
Did you want to see your wife or not?
'Fore I stab her wit' this knife I got
I got a sci-fi plot like a science fiction flick that I'm a hit you wit'
I got the Outsidaz up in this bitch
Peace to Thirstin' Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed wit' badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna step to this and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer Earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin' wit' your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, it hurts worth
When they get abolished, polyps'll murk worse
Wrote a secret message inside of a word search
Wit' smeared letters, runnin' together in blurred spurts
Rappers can't fuck wit' me, hollerin', 'Nurse, nurse'
You said this shot would numb it, bitch, it just hurts worse
Rappers can't fuck wit' the way that I spit it, lyrical lit it

I'ma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, 'specially when you wrote ninety-percent of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'Fore you come up missin', like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of literature that I'm spittin' be hittin'
You gonna swear to God this shit was written
But it wasn't, I'll kill a dozen rappers when I'm buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now, you boys are about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than Vladimir Konstantinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and wipe this bloody video screen off

I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin', ""I'm about to whip his ass
‘Cause I'ma do some written shit, plus I get to go last.""
Well, guess what? Even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo' verse
I'm 'bout to slice you like a Ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take your fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope emcee?
Look, don't get mad and start takin' your period out on me

You wanna represent on the microphone, but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'ma do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Time of the month? You couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I rip him like a paper mache
I heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched, like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out, like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush
I don't give a fuck, ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin' back with pimp shit
I laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the Rap Olympics

[RAP BATTLE 4]
Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah—stop babblin'!
You so fuckin' wack I'ma walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion
Don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style is just one big sike
Take a big hike, bitch, you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit, like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew
And I don't give a fuck, I slaughter boys
Especially wack-ass emcees that will wear a fake-ass corduroy

I'm 'bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck—this shit fits you perfect!
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with you
I'll let a razor slit you, 'til they have to staple-stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn! All your white jokes just backfired
‘Cause, bitch, you barkin' up the wrong tree
Now go tell all your boys that you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya

Wanna see me stick her fucking eyeballs right in to my anus?

She made me fall on my ass
The walls are caving in and I gotta go ham on this bitch
Like, woah, so we never fell in love so I didn't have to
Go through that shit no more
It's like a nugget, I'm hugging these sluts
That are bothering this fucking chick when I murder
And spit on the beat like the drugs I was taking
Just a bit of it
And stop slurping the blood off her face, or I'll murder you too with a bag full of mace and if Kim comes to my house and says ""Wanna get back together?""
And I say ""No, get out before I [slit your throat] and splatter the blood on this sweater!""

I'll use the payphone, this bitch is calling my dead phone, she won't leave me alone
Spent 75 cents on her, and she didn't answer

Yeah
Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me

[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?

Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me

Dreams pullin' up, I'm like ""skrrt""
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli (yeah)
You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready (woo)
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (huh)
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this (yeah)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, ""You made for this""
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
""#CardiBIsSoProblematic"" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash
I'm gigglin', can't let the devil have the last laugh
Ain't no more beefin', I'm just keepin' to myself

You don't like money, I can see it your eye
You don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie
Better be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly
She count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night
But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike
God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life
And that guala like Iyanla cause that bag just fixed my life
And y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne
But can we please get some more champagne?
Please, no Andre, G like 'Venchy

Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy

Uh.. Let me stop-by..
Thanking you know.. for allowing me to come back because this is one of the important days of the year to... next to y'know Christmas, my mother's birthday and my birthday
Now here goes the story...
My momma calls me and she says ""Baby, I'm down in Miami and they play your song all day long. You making a lot of money right now. So when you on the tour I know there's gonna be lot of girls out there tryna throw you their pussy""
(haha) I mean that's how my momma talks with me
She says ""Baby, imma want you to put three rubbers cause I don't want no girl out there fucking up our money

Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know a nigga payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should've got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, ""We want prenup! We want prenup!"" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
And on the 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his!
Maaan! he killed that bitch, they gave him 25 years, 25 years

126,"Yo it's the Lake Shore Drive
Keep it live, tight, raw
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
To be the format, your whole style on one beat
Insert the disk, watch a nigga press delete
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette, you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
And the nigga who fronted, word to God, they don't want it
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther, but it ain't original
Because I stole it from the future, now I'm wanted in three centuries
The verbal killin', ask me where I got the style
Told 'em from my grandchildren, put it on files
Document it in the books
You niggas can't see me so cease the hard looks
I'll rather it get took
Live and die for rhymes, dedicated to hip-hop
Shit don't stop
Niggas they wanna know what and who's next
And you roll up in a Lex
That's the train stop, my brain drop mad lyrics
I rhyme with the spirit off the top, I drop nonstop
Verbally killin', my style is ready to willin'
Y'all niggas stay back chillin'
Like EPMD y'all niggas ain't seein' me, what
We're enormous, nah, do or die
I got the rhymes on the brain
They tried to bomb me on the plane so I rode the train
Before I got here, spawned here
I'm 'bout to save this shit, yo it's my year, what!?

I told her to drive over after dude crib
Bring a couple new friends
Them last girls was too thick
How you expect me to hit?
You wanna watch Clueless
I wanna watch Foolish
Excuse me, miss, I don't appreciate your rudeness
But if you strip, I will appreciate your nudeness
I heard the best head come from girls that is toothless
Yeah my game ruthless, yeah my car roofless
Spit that ""Through The Wire"" over Chaka Khan, ruthless
She said she had a friend look like Janet Jackson
That bitch came over lookin' more like Freddie Jackson
Nah, nah, nah, baby, won't be no time for no action
I'm just gon' play this ""Slow Jamz,"" holla at your man

[Verse 2]
Old school like Melle Mel
Or we could go to the D where Drelle Drel
Or DC, PG, or ATL
Back in Chi, I mean my life like a magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my ebony
Well that's XXL
Father penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a black tail
I'm feelin' the vibe, her body and soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well let's kill all the pollyin', I offer you a Cosmopolitan
Let's jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends say I'm a player, you'd be lucky to keep me
You know people gon' be talkin' 'bout us weekly
My car be in a robbery
P-O-R-T but what's more important to me is that
Don't be comin' 'round my girl tryna act like Mr. Friendly
And steal the spotlight like Mr. Bentley
I spotted her like Spud McKenzie
And for them fake boobies, I paid them Benjis
Get your own
I got Paris, he got Nicky, he tried to get him a clone
He said, ""Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold""
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus niece
Can I please say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heat rock, spit like a beatbox
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switched my girls around like 3L dub
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now she's a Christian
My white girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pullin' girls off the bench like a 6th man
I'm in the club pullin' the same old two step
While Omegas doin' the same old Q step
I had my money on my mind, I was thinkin' green
She a pledge, AKA, she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We sayin' the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spittin' game, I was scrimmagin'
My penmanship is so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicago win 'til Chicago wins
'Til we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, gettin' laid or gettin' paid
I just know when I'm gettin' one the other's gettin' away
I have to say, we goin' to mass today
We have to pray, these niggas is wack and aye I have to say
Since Pac passed away
Most these niggas don't even deserve a track from me
First of all, let's get rid of them Louis Vuitton boots
And get your tall ass out that C-Class coupe
You see the whiskey, had them girls feelin' frisky
You was with me, she said, ""Who's your sensei?""
And even if they wanna get busy
And freaky like Missy and roll some weed up
You'll roll 3 blunts and fuck up 3 blunts
Mothafucka you would fuck up a free lunch
Dawg, keep it right thurr like Chingy
Your girl don't like me? How long has she been gay?
Spanish girls ask me, ""No habla ingles""
And everybody wanna run to me for their sin-glay
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg if I was you I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg if I was you I'd kill myself
That Ethiopian chick drinkin' straight up liquor
I told her I'm Nigerian, that's straight up nigga
She claimed she ain't hear me on ""The Bounce"" with Jigga
She claimed she ain't see me on the basement with Tigga
Them both my niggas, I suppose
I might have been doin' a lil' frontin' for the hoes
When I flip flows, I rip shows
And your girlfriends, can I hit those?
I don't know if it's me, or do them Uggs
Got girl's feets lookin' like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme with her name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I ain't famous
My apologies, are you into astrology?
Cause umm... I'm tryna make it to your anus
See that's a little John Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John's name
Niggas tryna figure out since Kan' came
Who the rookie of the year: me or LeBron James?
They said, ""Woah don't get caught up in the hype""
Ain't no tellin' they gon' love you after tonight
Well if tonight's the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend moeny 'til you're broke, my nigga, live your life
Cause I'm livin' international, nigga, the American dream
All my dawgs is livin' vicariously through me
If I get head from Drene, that's one for the team
Cause 702, that's one for the crew
My dawg Hip-Hop really love Claudette
So if I ever get to smash, this fuck's for you
I can barely drive the G5 down King Drive
Cause like a Brinks truck, they know there's money inside

[Intermission]
I'ma take a little intermission
I'ma let y'all just talk about how good I rap for a minute and I'ma come back

[Verse 3]
So I dropped out of school cause I'm tryna eff the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit her with this maneuver, he just couldn't recuper'
I'm tryna stab one like Jack The Ripper
I'm tryna stab two like Jack The Tripper
My nigga Tone been locked for a minute
He come home, he from the skreets, he gon' want him some skrippers
And I'm a big tipper, I don't even be trippin'
This my first real Rolex, it don't even be tickin'
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without 'em cloudin' up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper gettin' jean
4 Gs in the Rocawear jeans
This top red hot like Anthony Kiedis
You see this? These are the sweetest Adidas
We fire, y'all retire
All ugly people, please be quiet
Hov ain't get a beat from me in a minute
He heard ""Just to Get By"" and I was re-hired
I got a track right now that could save Mya
Laughs I do though...",hiphop

Car stripper, trife livin
Show you what I'm paid but you won't get it
Already spent it, hundred thou ? 16 ?
Make you feel like the richest No! (niggas)
What happen when them cloths won't fit ya
And everybody asking for pictures, onto the next
One fan say ya sick man others say my shit weak
I do not sweat them, I am but a risk, band
Young money mulligan play gulf on ya head
Swing swing like lesbians and a man
Don't wanna share his wife but we already did (bitch)
Ghetto fly nigga form his ship
Its like amistad all black when we dip ah
Car with with rims ah don't matter what we in cuz we already in forever
The end chivalry I good night this shit
Goodbye to the flaw say hello to you God
Readin the choir overseas ummm....
Such a globe traveler, farchulin while you where at home
I was busy ordering steaks threw the phone like medium rare, no wait well done
Don't care if you won
Tyga I am the one

(Chorus)
This is why I'm ill 09 until
This is why I'm ill 09 until
This is why I'm ill 09 until
Forever y'all
This is why I'm ill 09 until

This is why I'm ill 09 until
This is why I'm ill 09 until
Forever y'all

I really kick flow
I really been broke
Look at me now doe everynight another show
What are those doe
Glow in the dark shoes
How you get those
Wish I really knew
Like mario, my city red and blue
Born from L.A. eat roscoes
Lucy tacos knew some vatos
Tat tata tat ink like kinkos
I put a dollar in the pot watch the pot grow
I pop up with the heat like hot toast
You would recycle if you see what I knew
So keep your eyes closed and lower your IQ
I feel like two, they can judge me but there's no gaffle and stool
Only gospel can save you good music immune
I'm ill sick my lyrics like pew

It's 2 AM in the mornin
Pressin my alarm again
Stressin over my mom and friends
Sometimes, I wish I was in a coma

Damn! Wakin up to the cold wind
Sometimes, I wish I was a kid again
Sometimes, I don't even wanna remember it
Cause one time I remembered what I couldn't forget
Damn! My stepdad beatin me again
For a bad grade, he must of had A's
The way he was hurtin me in a bad way
My mom hearin the scream but just turned away
What the fuck, are you people crazy?
I was only a baby, five months when they gave me
To my grandma, who was racist
But I ain't give a fuck, I just faced it
Like mace to the police, I was danger
Feelin like I'm in a manger
Baby Jesus, save me from the anger
She's tryin to get me, into this closet I vanished quickly
Fuck that, I took 50
From her purse bag, told her ""Don't miss me""
I ain't comin back, catch me on another path
I need a bubble bath
Someone, take me in the plastic basket
Sittin on bubble wrap, I'm abandoned
I need a new home, that isn't damaged
A family whom care, to be parents
Errant, my life on the mic
Might wasn't raised too right, so I
Had to decide to turn on the light
Do somethin right, before I'm layin with the mice
Rotten alone on my neighbor's stolen bike
Tryin to think what my afterlife, gon' look like
It gotta look right... it gotta look right...

[Chorus]
Back to my bad life
Another day in the fast life got me feelin like I'm on the crack pipe
No lie, just the thought
Of me gettin that type of high, but I'm in the dark
Where the shadows, follow, your every walk
And as I move, I'm feelin like a shopping cart
Gimme this, gimme that son
What'chu mean - ain't you supposed to be my mom?
Why don't you ask God, I worked hard for these two dimes
I care what it's worth - just the fact that it's mine
Check your purse, don't you got
My life savings that you've been savin from birth?
Oh - I forgot you spent that
On your own gift wrap - I ain't get shit last Christmas
But a hug and a family wishlist for next year and shit
Huh! 'Round next year and shit
I'm gonna be on shit you can't even pronounce, in English
I got anger
That's why I paint these songs, visually painting
It's awful ain't it? A little (Pinky) in (The Brain)
But hopefully, time is the pain
Cause as of now, I just wanna run away... run away...

We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up

Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?

I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me
He was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up

Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose

And tell me today's weather

Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow

139,"The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was ""Pon de Replay,"" and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called ""Work.""

Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.

Captivating from day one, the iconic being known as Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them that's often a peak, but for her that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.

When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.

What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.

This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.

She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry.

Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo'-fo'
Ask you what you laughing at - represent that mud life!
Dirty money bitch you better get yo' mud right!

Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, Hardaway, cross 'em up

Don't mess with us, we like the U in the 80's

Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!

Damn, I ain't trying to fight that
But if we fall too fast will the feeling last
Now I'm looking over my shoulder, shoulder, uh
Champagne, good dimes and good times and now it's all over

I pick up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
Its Saturday y'all, here's the plan
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand

Until the point where I can’t stand
No nothing picks me up like a beer can

Well it's Sunday now and I'm freaking out
'Cause I can’t handle five days without

Yeah, picking up a beer can and get to feeling like superman

We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand

[Verse 1]
I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun is starting to peak
Through my window, lettin' me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting
And a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer
And a little something stashed
In the back of the car, so relax
There ain't a beach too far

We'll be road-tripping
Rolling with the top down
South bound
Little bikinis in white sand
In a tank top
Gonna let the guns out, all about
Rocking that farmer's tan

All the girls looking heavenly
Buncha kick back and chill
Out ahead of me
Gettin' wild, raisin' hell
And leavin' this town

Got that Daiquiri kiss

So before careful when you're holding one

Still be friends

A couple long necks deep in a pink inflatable chair

We gonna float
Like that ice cube melting right here in my Jack and Coke
Like a bobber on the water gonna ride this thing real slow
All I want to do is float

There ain't no way any trouble's getting to me
When I'm drifting with the red stripe just like that buoy
Just take me to the redneck riviera
Fake Ray Bans and tank top tans
A couple long necks deep in a pink inflatable chair

We gonna float
Like that ice cube melting right here in my Jack and Coke
Like a Flora-Bama beach on the Gulf of Mexico
We just gonna coast

We gonna float
Like a bobber on the water gonna ride this thing real slow
Just sippin' something fizzy, getting dizzy, rolling with the flow
All I want to do is float

I'm talking F-L-O-A-T
Ocean, a kitty pool ain't gotta get to deep
I'm talking F-L-O-A-T
Fill something with air and fill your cup with a drink
You know it's F-L-O-A-T
Get your booty in the water, yeah you know you wanna

We gonna float
Like that ice cube melting right here in my Jack and Coke
Like a Flora-Bama beach on the Gulf of Mexico

Can you help me love this place?

For the trial that I face

But I'd give all I know to be called a child of yours
Though it may cost my soul I can't think of wanting more
Wanting more

You're my cool refreshing fountain
When the desert air is warm
You're my tall and mighty mountain
In the middle of the storm

Can you help me change my view?

Nowhere to go
No place to go

My eyes are sore from smoking all that shit
No place to go
Bottomless heart, so big that everything just gets lost in there
And if it never comes out, that's okay by me
And on other side, at the top there may light at the end of the tunnel
I just don't think I'll be the same
I'm just warning you
I'm warning you all
No crutches, no nothin'
I am going to live the end
Apocalypse man
What the hell else is there to do
I want a mission
Not a gig or a good time, I want a mission
Scrawny stiff legs and despair come walkin my way with an achy step
Shipwrecked souls, desolation paradise
Bountiful wonderland of lost souls staggering around arms out stretched looking
For something lonely hero man sitting on the crest of the apocalypse
And our boy says something like uh
Hey sir, I'm a man away from home, and my soul is out on loan
Could you throw us down a bone, so I wouldn't be all alone
Cause I wanna see it all, and I wanna have it all, and I wanna see it fall
And I wanna take it all away

Birthday new shirt around my neck
Shivers up and down my spine
The time is mine and I'm feelin fine
And I take this one thin dime
And I call my mom on the phone and say
Say something to warm her heart
Say uhh your boy done fucked up
Had a bit of hard luck, went down a wrong trail, messed with the wrong people
And just lost his mind just lost his mind just lost his mind
Just lost his mind just lost his mind just lost his mind just lost his mind
Jumped! get stuck in the trunk, got stuck in the jungle
And their jokes and their votes and their wrong side looks, and all the notes in the books
And all the wrong turns and all the bad burns
And he never learned to not get burned and he never learned
One more wrong turn led to another wrong turn
Dog people! These people are for real, they watch television
They run in circles, they bark like dogs, they nip at my heels
They wanna put a collar around my neck, they want me to be like them
Well I just walk right past, right over 'em, right though 'em, right on top of them
I crush their face 'cause it's easy, 'cause they're nothing. 'cause they're nothing
Little dogs, humping dogs, sticking that thing in any crack that passes by
Dirt falling in my mind, dirt gets stuck in my mouth, dirt gets stuck in my eyes
Seeing everything through dirt, all I see is dirt, all I know is dirt just talking dirt
Talking dirt, Digging dirt, loving dirt, rolling in dirt
Dirt river, dirt slithers, dirt lovers, dirt undercover, dirt over color
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah
I've felt dirty before, but it never felt quite like this
I've seen dirt before but it never looked quite looked like this
I've talked dirt before but it never sounded quite like this
That's not the way it is that's just the way it is around here around these parts
Ooo!
It took a long time to make a long rhyme
It took a long time to make a story short
It took a lotta lives and a lotta lies to make this story what it is
And stretch it into a disgusting distortion and proportion and detail
And you can retail that, and sell it to the market and see what you get
Bring back the proceeds and we'll spend it on something of worth
Something that will save me, something that will get me out of here
There's nothing I want more like out
There's nothing I like to roll in like dirt look!
Ashamed of myself I've looked at myself I've hated myself
And if we could all just get together and hate a little we could hate one another
Hate our sisters and brothers in the sea of disunity
Get my fill when the blood spills
Get my fill when the blood spills
Get my fill when the blood spills
I get my freeze with the chill spells
I get my thrills with the cheers feel
I get my thrills with the cheers feels
The glass breaks
Chills up and down my spine and I'm feeling fine
I was feeling fine, the time is mine
Spending time to time getting my beer and all the gulls wing inside my head
And alarms going on and off
All fucked up
All messed up…
Open my eyes, too much breathing
Too much of that fucking dirty air makes me talk shit makes me live shit
Makes me wanna kiss the ground, better than kissing you dirt girl, in that dirt dress
What's up that dirt dress what's up that dirt dress ain't nothing but a bunch a trash
Ain't nothing but a bunch a trash ain't nothing but a bunch a trash
Ain't nothing but a bunch a trash, but you seem to have me quite interested
Quite interested, I think I'll walk your way, I think I'll say your name
I think I'll come over to your house
Eeeuw you got something for me you got something for me
I'm the man among men walking tall with a plan
You can send it around the world, you can hold it in your hand
You can bring it on home, I'm Armageddon man girl
Armageddon man girl, armageddon man girl
And I want the whole world I want the whole world I want the whole world

Guess what, this might come as a surprise
I'll no longer roll my eyes
A change of heart to let the conscience breath
One quick twist, just 180 degrees

Yeah, I now know the right thing to do
Yeah, anti tradition tried and true
Yeah, a world where wrong has right of way
Yeah, fuck that world, fuck that heirarchy

Go ahead, work, waste your life away
Fuck that world, go fuck that right away",punk
294,"I'm not here to entertain you
I'm here to meet my friend the Russian
The Irish, the German, the Columbian

I don't care how bad I fuck up
I care about how fucked up I get
I'm not your clown
I'm your dealer

And I'm holding three bindles of bullshit
And you're buyin' them cause you are addicted
To the pure and totally uncut

I'm not here to amuse you
I'm here to abuse my body
I'm here because old habits die hard

And seriously, what else am I supposed to do?
This isn't my job, my hobby, my habit
It's sad, but this is my life

Welcome to our mission statement
Total self-debasement
And not giving our all

Watch us Fall!

It's not that we don't pull it
It's just that we only give about 60 or so percent

Would you rather be fed bullshit
From some 20-something, makeup wearing, popstar

""This one goes out to all our fans all over the world
Without you, we'd just be us
So, I just wanna say thank you!
We fuckin' love you, Modesto!""

Fuck you!

And you're takin' it easy before the show
So you won't lose your voice
And disappoint your fans routine

And you don't care about the children
You don't even know them
All you know is their money",punk
