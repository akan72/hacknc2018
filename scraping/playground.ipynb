She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was \"Pon de Replay,\" and the director... and the director of the video was Little X.

It\\'s hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called \"Work.\"\\n\\nToday the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta.

For them that\\'s often a peak, but for her that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.\\n\\nWhen it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release.

What\\'s most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in.
